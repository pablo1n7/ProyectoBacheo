All schema files are stored here:

The schemas themselves are stored in schema/ e.g. schema/users.sql with a schema for every table in the database

Schema data is then stored in the data directory:

- Any data which is critical to the application running, e.g. countries, should be saved into data/required
- Any data which is used for testing the application should be saved in data/sample
